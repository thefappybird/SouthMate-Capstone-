# SouthMate-Capstone-
Hello, this is my Capstone Project on SouthMate.
SouthMate is an online banking service of some sorts that is exclusively used within schools. In this project, I am focusing on creating the website with my school, USPF as the base. The app will include a Website and a (hopefully) functioning mobile app.
